- `CS205_small_Data__22.txt` & `CS205_large_Data__45.txt`: assigned small and large datasets
- `VisualizationsAndPart2.ipynb`: Python Notebook used to create visualizations used in report, simply used main code + run forward on chosen dataset for part 2
- `spambase.data`: Chosen dataset for part 2
## Instructions for running locally
